gedit-open-selection
====================

Open Selection plugin for gedit.

Opens the currently selected path in a new tab.
Considers the currently selected text to be the name of a (local) file
which is opened in a new tab by pressing Ctrl-Shift-O or the corresponding
menu entry. Globs like * are expanded, possibly to multiple files in
multiple new tabs. Tilde (~) is expanded as well.

Tested with gedit 3.4 on Ubuntu 12.04, gedit 3.10 on Ubuntu 14.04 and gedit 3.12 on Ubuntu 16.04.
Check out the tag for your gedit version to make it work with your system.
